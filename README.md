# üõ°Ô∏èSigning and Verifying AWS Central ECR Images with AWS Signer
![arch-diagram](centralecr.png "Central ECR, AWS Signer")

This is an extremely basic setup, using a central ECR with a pull through cache from upstream Dockerhub. 

## Prerequisites:
-	Two AWS Accounts in the same AWS Organization. 
-	Github Actions enabled Github repository. 
-	OIDC deployment role for both accounts. 
-	Basic knowledge of Terraform. 

## Holistic view:
### Two AWS Accounts: 
o	Security account: Hosting the central ECR and AWS Signer Profile.
o	Application account: Pulling a base image and verifying its signature. 
### Three Github Actions pipelines in Github Repo: 
o	‚Äòdeployinfra.yaml‚Äô to deploy basic infrastructure in Security and Application account. 
o	‚Äòmirror-and-sign.yml‚Äô to pull an image, sign it and push to Central ECR in the Security account.
o	‚Äòpull-and-verify.yaml‚Äô to pull an image from the central ECR and verifying its signature. 
### AWS Services
-	AWS Signer: AWS Signer profile used to perform sign and verify jobs. 
-	ECR: Centralised ECR in the Security account.
-	Pull Through Cache: Provides means of caching images from a upstream registry in a private ECR.
